# Jourdan Rodrigues' dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles! You're totally free to give me suggestions on it, 
though I think you have your own life to take care of.

### Add new files

In this repo, everything is ignored. To add new files to it, you need to 
add the `-f` parameter to the `git add` command, like the following:

```bash
git add -f cool_file
```
